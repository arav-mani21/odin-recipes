# odin-recipes
This project is a website that displays recipes of 3 of my favorite dishes.
The website includes a home page and a webpage for each dish detailing the recipe.
Each recipe includes a description, ingredients, and steps for making the dish.

Through making this website, I have learned the basics of using HTML, which include how to use elements to build the foundation of a webpage.
